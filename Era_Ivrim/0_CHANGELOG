	Era_Ivrim
________________________________________________________________________________
Ivrim 	:
Ivrim is the name of a faction and a subgroup within. The word actually comes from "ivri" meaning from the other side [of the river], ~im being the plural form. Imagine, that they mostly fight with bronze weaponry, for iron is rather expensive.
